Hello :)

This is a project for the task I got from ComIT International when i applied for the job on the position for Frontend developer

I got a design in Figma that I needed to turn into a site using React.JS

In the assignment I got a link where the data is located, and link is protected with CORS, so you have to use Extension CORS Unblock on your browser.

Also, I done it with SASS, it is fun way to do CSS

Any advice is wellcome :)
